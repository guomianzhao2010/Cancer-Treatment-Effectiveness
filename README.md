# Effectiveness of Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) Treatment on Animals 

In this project, I was provided with data from a fictional pharmaceutical company specializing in drug-based, anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. In their most recent efforts, they've since begun screening for potential treatments to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.
In their most recent study, 250 mice were treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days. Their physiological responses were then monitored over the course of that time. My objective was to analyze the data to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare.
In addition to routine data cleaning and consolidation using Pandas, I also used Matplotlib to create the following 4 charts:

A scatter plot that shows how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment.

A scatter plot that shows how the number of metastatic (cancer spreading) sites changes over time for each treatment.

A scatter plot that shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate).

A bar graph that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days.
